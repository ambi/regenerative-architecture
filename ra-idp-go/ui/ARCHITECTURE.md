# Frontend / Backend Architecture

## Deployment boundary

React and Go are separate build artifacts and separate services.

```text
Browser
  |
  | same origin
  v
Gateway / static server (Caddy, Nginx, CDN + proxy, etc.)
  |-- /login, /consent, /device, /status, /admin/* -> React SPA
  `-- /api/* and OAuth/OIDC endpoints                -> Go
```

Caddy is the reference configuration, not a required runtime. Any gateway that preserves the
same-origin boundary, TLS, headers, and routing contract can replace it.

## Authorization transaction

The Go service keeps the complete OAuth authorization request server-side. Its internal UUID is
stored only in a short-lived `HttpOnly`, `Secure` in HTTPS, `SameSite=Lax` transaction cookie.
It is not included in HTML, URLs, or JavaScript-readable application state.

The SPA calls `GET /api/auth/transaction` to obtain only display data such as the screen kind,
client name, and requested scopes. Login and consent commands resolve the transaction from the
cookie.

## Browser protections

- Session and authorization transaction cookies are `HttpOnly`.
- State-changing UI APIs require a double-submit CSRF cookie and `X-CSRF-Token` header.
- State-changing browser APIs require an `Origin` header matching the configured public issuer.
- Consent verifies that the current login session subject matches the authorization transaction.
- Authorization requests expire after ten minutes and completed requests cannot be reused.
- OAuth redirect URIs, PKCE values, scopes, and client identifiers are read from server-side state.
- UI API responses use `Cache-Control: no-store` and never return credentials or internal request IDs.

## API boundary

Browser-facing authentication APIs live under `/api/auth/*`. OAuth/OIDC protocol endpoints retain
their standard paths. Future management APIs belong under `/api/admin/*` and must use explicit
authorization policies independently from the login transaction APIs.
